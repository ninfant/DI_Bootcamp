Exercise 1: Implement A Task Manager

Instructions

Objective: Create a React task management system 
that allows different components to manage tasks
using useContext and useReducer.

Set up a new React project using create-react-app or your preferred method.

Create a context for managing tasks.

Implement a task provider that includes a reducer for managing tasks.

Create components for adding tasks, displaying tasks, and removing tasks. These components should use the task context to interact with the task state.

Implement actions in the reducer for adding, completing, and removing tasks.

Hints:

Each task can be represented as an object with properties like id, text, and completed.

Use a unique id for each task to identify and remove them.

Edit Tasks: Allow users to edit existing tasks by clicking on them.

Filter Tasks: Implement buttons to filter tasks by completion status (e.g., show all, show completed, show active).

Use useRef to enable task editing and update the task text when the user makes changes.

Implement actions in the reducer for editing tasks and filtering tasks.

Hints:

To enable task editing, you can add an “Edit” button next to each task that, when clicked, activates an input field for editing the task text.

Use a state variable or a ref to track the edited task text before saving.

Implement actions like EDIT_TASK and FILTER_TASKS in the reducer to handle task editing and filtering.

Use conditional rendering to display tasks based on the selected filter.
